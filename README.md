The Monkeeys Band Website

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
This is my website of the 19060’s rock band ‘The Monkeeys’ for fans who would like see music clips, catalog and any new music that becomes available. The website showcases their music and will publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

UX

My goal in design was to deliver an easy to navigate website allowing users to easily access the information they require. The band performing has been used a background on more than one occasion as this could be hold the fans attention.
I wanted the landing page to be an opportunity to book the band in for possible gigs.
For fans, I wanted to provide access to video and audio performances via a user friendly design in the music section.
The Tour section will then allow users to see where the band will be performing in the coming months and easily book ticket. The ticket booking page opens on a new tab so fans are not directed away from the website.
The footer contains links to the bands Facebook, Twitter, LinkIn, Snapchat and Youtube account to increase the social presence of the Monkees
